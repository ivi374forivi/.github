# Governance

This document outlines the governance model for the **ivi374forivi** organization and its projects.

## Project Leadership

### Maintainers

Maintainers are responsible for:
- Reviewing and merging pull requests
- Managing releases and versioning
- Triaging and prioritizing issues
- Setting project direction and roadmap
- Enforcing the Code of Conduct

### Contributors

All contributors are welcome and valued. Contributors who demonstrate:
- Consistent high-quality contributions
- Deep understanding of the project
- Commitment to the community

May be invited to become maintainers.

## Decision Making

### Consensus-Based Decisions

We strive to make decisions through consensus when possible:
1. Proposals are discussed openly in issues or discussions
2. Community feedback is gathered and considered
3. Maintainers work toward agreement
4. If consensus cannot be reached, maintainers vote

### Voting

When voting is required:
- Each maintainer has one vote
- Simple majority (>50%) wins
- Votes are conducted transparently in issues or discussions

## Changes to Governance

This governance document may be amended through:
1. Proposal via pull request
2. Discussion period (minimum 7 days)
3. Approval by majority of maintainers

## Communication

### Channels

- **Issues**: Bug reports, feature requests, and technical discussions
- **Pull Requests**: Code reviews and implementation discussions
- **Discussions**: General questions, ideas, and community conversations (if enabled)

### Expectations

- Be respectful and professional
- Follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- Provide constructive feedback
- Document decisions and rationale

## Conflict Resolution

If conflicts arise:
1. Attempt to resolve through direct, respectful discussion
2. If unresolved, involve other maintainers
3. Maintainers will mediate and make final decisions
4. Serious violations of the Code of Conduct may result in removal from the project

## Recognition

We value all contributions:
- Contributors are recognized in release notes
