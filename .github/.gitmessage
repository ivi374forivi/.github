# Types:

# More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to about 72
# characters or so. The blank line separating the summary from the body
# is critical (unless you omit the body entirely).
#
# Explain the problem that this commit is solving. Focus on why you are
# making this change as opposed to how (the code explains that).
# Are there side effects or other unintuitive consequences of this change?
# Here's the place to explain them.
#
# Further paragraphs come after blank lines.
#
# - Bullet points are okay, too
# - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, followed by a
#   single space
#
# If you use an issue tracker, put references to them at the bottom,
# like this:
#
# Resolves: #123
# See also: #456, #789
